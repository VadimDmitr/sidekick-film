      <h2>Why Video Matters…</h2>
      <p>
        Everyone with a Smart Phone is seeing video content. Over 254 million
        Americans watch YouTube. Did you know, a whopping 73.3% of target
        consumers 25-55 years-old watch YouTube content weekly. Video is
        powerful, delivers the biggest bang for the buck, and is here to stay.
        It’s your time to leverage video—a multi-generational medium that’s
        sharable with an email link, in a text, on your website, on social
        media, or as a QR code.
